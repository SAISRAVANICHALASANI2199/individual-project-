# PROBLEM STATEMENT
We are going toÂ create a Marketplace program that will contain inventory information that enables customer to buy things by creating products. There are only a few objects left in the inventory. The number of things bought from each genre will be limited. If an item meets all of the criteria, the entire quantity due will be assessed, and payment information will be utilized to complete the transaction.
